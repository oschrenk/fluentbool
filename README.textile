This project was a training exercise for creating fluent interfaces and using object oriented paradigm to write boolean expressions in a more natural approach.

You create boolean filters that evaluate a specific type (using generics) and decide whether it should be accepted within a specific context. It offers a more generic approach as java.io.FileFilter, offering to evaluate any type.

With this fluent interface you create expression like this (an example of an implementation of the XOR expression):

bc. boolFilter = expFilter.start(falseFilter).and().not(falseFilter).or().not(falseFilter).and(falseFilter).build();
